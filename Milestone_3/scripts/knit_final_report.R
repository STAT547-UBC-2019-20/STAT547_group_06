#This is a script to knit the draft final_report.Rmd to an html and pdf file

#Be done in Rmarkdown and should not have any “hard-coded” (use r code chunks and inline r code) numbers and values
#Have an introduction/motivation and description of research question
#Have a section describing your dataset (EDA); make sure you import pngs from the images directory rather than creating them again!
#  Have a section for your methods (placeholder for a linear regression to be done next week)
#Have a section for your results (placeholder for a linear regression to be done next week)
#Have a section for your discussion/conclusion (placeholder for a linear regression to be done next week)
#Be a new, different document than the EDA document you submitted for milestone1 (though you can liberally borrow from your report, particularly the introduction)

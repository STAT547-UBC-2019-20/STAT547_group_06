#Perform the EDA you did in week 1 and save the plots as separate png files (these will be imported in by your final report)
#Take in a path where exported images should be saved (likely images) as a command-line argument
#Run without any intervention from the user after running the script from a terminal/command prompt
#Print a helpful message to the terminal informing the user that the script completed successfully

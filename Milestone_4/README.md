STAT547 Milestone 4 Repo
===================
Changes made from Milestone 3 based on feedback:
* EDA_script.R was split into EDA_images_script.R and EDA_LM_script.R for images and linear regression (Feedback [here](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/group_06/issues/52))
* make all creates final_report outputs in docs folder (Feedback [here](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/group_06/issues/52))
* Warnings of scripts were suppressed (Feedback [here](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/group_06/issues/36))
* Scripts have proper documentation based on [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) style (Feedback [here](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/group_06/issues/35))
* unit tests were added to scripts (_To Do if we have time_) (Feedback [here](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/group_06/issues/37))
* in EDA_images_script.R, create a function for each plot that is then called on by main() (Feedback [here](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/group_06/issues/35)) (_To Do if we have time_)
* Changes to analyses were done for more informative results (not based on feedback)




**Usage**
==================
_Instructions for how to completely reproduce this analysis using individual scripts_

1. Clone this repo.

2. Ensure the following packages are installed:

  - ggplot2
  - tidyverse
  - glue
  - docopt
  - broom
  - tibble
  - purr
  - docopt
  - plotly
  - dash


3. To replicate this analysis, clone this repository, navigate to the `Milestone_3` folder in your terminal, and type in the following commands (in order):

**In the Milestone_4 folder as working directory**

 **Download data with load_data.R** \
  Rscript scripts/load_data.R --URL="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data" --filepath="data/adult_data.csv"
  
  **Wrangle/clean/process the data with process_data.R** \
  Rscript scripts/process_data.R --raw_data="data/adult_data.csv" --processed="adult_data_clean.csv"
  
  **EDA script to export images with EDA_images_script.R** \
  Rscript scripts/EDA_images_script.R --image_path="images/" 
  
  **EDA script to export images with EDA_LM_script.R** \
  Rscript scripts/EDA_LM_script.R --RDS_path="data/" 
  
  **Knit the .Rmd final report into pdf and html documents** \
  Rscript scripts/knit_final_report.R --final_report="docs/final_report.Rmd"
  
_Instructions for how to completely reproduce this analysis using GNU MAKE_
1. Go to the terminal, cd to Milestone_4 
2. Type the following for the desired outcomes: \
\
a.`make clean` removes all files generated by the scripts.\
 _To run `make all` , all folders need to be cleaned with `make clean` first_

b. `make all` runs through all the scripts from loading the raw data to knitting the final report to a html and pdf documents.

# Introduction


Hello!! We are STAT 547M Students (Saelin and Carleena) and this is our group project repository.

You will find our milestone activitities in this repo as follows:

# Dashboard Proposal

## Description
This dashboard will allow the user to graphically explore the effects of several factors (e.g. age, relationship or role in the family, education level, and race) on the number of work hours each week by selecting the appropriate option in the dropdown menu. 

Selecting a categorical variable (race, relationship or education level) will display two plots, a box plot and a density plot, with groups of that variable on the x-axis and hours worked per week on the y-axis. A "Separate by sex" checkbox will determine if the user wants to display the information separated by sex, side-by-side on the plot. The sexes will be colour coded (blue for males and red for females). A slider is included to filter the data displayed to the audience's preferred age range. 

In contrast to the categorical variables, selecting age from the dropdown menu will instead produce a line graph, with age on the x-axis and hours worked per week on they-axis. Selecting "Separate by sex" will produce two trend lines, one for women (red) and one for men (blue). The age slider will also be included to filter the data to the user's preferred age range, which will dynamically change the x-axis to that range. 

## Usage Scenario

Mary is in the human resources department of her company. She and her team were asked to [understand] the factors that influence employee productivity to hopefully [maximize] the productivity of their company. She wants to [explore] the dataset to accomplish this goal. She 

An example usage scenario with tasks (tasks are indicated in brackets, i.e. [task])

Mary is a policy maker with the Canadian Ministry of Health and she wants to understand what factors lead to missed appointments in order to devise an intervention that improves attendance numbers. She wants to be able to [explore] a dataset in order to [compare] the effect of different variables on absenteeism and [identify] the most relevant variables around which to frame her intervention policy. When Mary logs on to the “Missed Appointments app”, she will see an overview of all the available variables in her dataset, according to the number of people that did or did not show up to their medical appointment. She can filter out variables for head-to-head comparisons, and/or rank order patients according to their predicted probability of missing an appointment. When she does so, Mary may notice that “physical disability” appears to be a strong predictor missing appointments, and in fact patients with a physical disability also have the largest number of missed appointments. She hypothesizes that patients with a physical disability could be having a hard time finding transportation to their appointments, and decides she needs to conduct a follow-on study since transportation information is not captured in her current dataset.

Note that in the above example, “physical disability” being an important variable is fictional - you don’t need to conduct an analysis of your data to figure out what is important or not, you just need to imagine what someone could find, and how they may use this information.

## Example sketch

The example sketch shows the visual design of the app and one interactive feature (a tooltip).

A further note on the app sketches:

This sketch is drawn up Powerpoint and using icons from the [noun project](https://thenounproject.com/). You can use others graphics tools (i.e. Photoshop, Illustrator, GIMP, or Inkscape, etc.) or you can even draw you app by hand and upload the scanned version of your drawing. Whatever you choose to do, make sure that the final image in your report is legible. Please note, this is a very basic illustrative guide to help you in this milestone, it is by no means the limit of what you should submit.

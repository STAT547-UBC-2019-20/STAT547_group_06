# Introduction


Hello!! We are STAT 547M Students and this is our group project repository.

You will find our milestone activitities in this repo as follows:

# Dashboard Proposal
The next part of your project requires you to create a dashboard for your dataset. You need to make a proposal for a dashboard and it should have two components:

Dashboard description and usage scenarios (~ 300 words)
Dashboard sketch
If necessary, you should consider revising your research question(s) based on the feedback of your peers, and so it is appropriate for a dashboard. Then, consider how the dashboard can be used to answer your research question(s) by a fictional person - these are usage scenarios. Building from your research questions, give a high-level description of the interface for the app you will build. Remember to be realistic about your expectations and plans since you will actually be implementing this app next week and the week after. All of this content should be approximately 300 words and live in the main project README.md file of your GitHub.com repository.

## Description
In this description you are not required to use terminology specific to Dash apps (i.e. widgets, components, etc…) or make reference to specific libraries. Your sketch can be hand-drawn or mocked up using a graphics editor. If you can show the app visual design & interaction design in a single image that is ideal, but if you need more space to show other planned features of your app you can include up to a total of THREE images for this proposal. The sketch should be posted in the README.md file of your GitHub.com repository underneath the high level description.

### Example description

This app will have a landing page that shows the distribution (depending on data type, bar chart, density chart etc) of dataset factors (hypertension, physical disabilities etc.) colour coded according to whether or not patients showed up for an appointment. From a dropdown list, users will be able to filter out variables from the distribution display, by patient demographics (i.e. only show female patients), by appointment data (i.e. if SMS was sent), and finally by the date range of appointments. A different dropdown menu will allow users to re-order variables according to the probability of patients being a no-show or in alphabetical order to comorbidities. Users can compare the distribution of co-morbidities by scrolling down through the app interface.

## Usage Scenario
Usage scenarios are typically written in a narrative style and include the specific context of usage, tasks associated with that usage context, and a hypothetical walkthrough of how the user would accomplish those tasks with your app. If you are using a Kaggle dataset, you may use their “Overview (inspiration)” to create your usage scenario, or you may come up with your own inspiration.

An example usage scenario with tasks (tasks are indicated in brackets, i.e. [task])

Mary is a policy maker with the Canadian Ministry of Health and she wants to understand what factors lead to missed appointments in order to devise an intervention that improves attendance numbers. She wants to be able to [explore] a dataset in order to [compare] the effect of different variables on absenteeism and [identify] the most relevant variables around which to frame her intervention policy. When Mary logs on to the “Missed Appointments app”, she will see an overview of all the available variables in her dataset, according to the number of people that did or did not show up to their medical appointment. She can filter out variables for head-to-head comparisons, and/or rank order patients according to their predicted probability of missing an appointment. When she does so, Mary may notice that “physical disability” appears to be a strong predictor missing appointments, and in fact patients with a physical disability also have the largest number of missed appointments. She hypothesizes that patients with a physical disability could be having a hard time finding transportation to their appointments, and decides she needs to conduct a follow-on study since transportation information is not captured in her current dataset.

Note that in the above example, “physical disability” being an important variable is fictional - you don’t need to conduct an analysis of your data to figure out what is important or not, you just need to imagine what someone could find, and how they may use this information.

## Example sketch

The example sketch shows the visual design of the app and one interactive feature (a tooltip).

A further note on the app sketches:

This sketch is drawn up Powerpoint and using icons from the [noun project](https://thenounproject.com/). You can use others graphics tools (i.e. Photoshop, Illustrator, GIMP, or Inkscape, etc.) or you can even draw you app by hand and upload the scanned version of your drawing. Whatever you choose to do, make sure that the final image in your report is legible. Please note, this is a very basic illustrative guide to help you in this milestone, it is by no means the limit of what you should submit.

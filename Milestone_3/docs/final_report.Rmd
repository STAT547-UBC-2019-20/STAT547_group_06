## Adult Income

### Introduction

#### The Dataset
Who: The data set was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database and is donated by Silicon Graphics \
What: This is a multivariate dataset with categorical and integer variables. It contains the predicted income of individuals from the census with attributes including age, marital status, work class, education, sex, and race. \
When: The data is from a 1994 census. \
Why: The data set is found in the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository, and was used for ML prediction of whether a person makes over or under 50K a year based on their attributes. \
How: The census data was collected by survey. 

#### The Research Questions 
Are the number of hours someone works per week correlated with their age, relationship, education level or sex?

### Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, we will get to know our dataset better by exploring the relationship between certain factors.

#### Age and Sex

The plot below shows that there are more male employees than female employees and that the majority of working males are older than working females since the male (blue curve) have a peak shifted to the right with respect to female (red peak).

#### Educational Leve and Income

We observe from the following graphs that a majority of individuals earning greater than $50,000 a year only accomplished high school irrespective of sex or ethnical background.

#### Number of Work Hours and Age

We can deduce from the graph below that individuals work the most hours between their 40's and 60's (probably full time at 40 hours or more a week) and that employees under 20 and over 80 years of age work the same number of hours (probably part time at 25 hours)

#### Marital Status and Number of Hours Worked

The plot below shows that the working hours between married individuals and single employees are similar.

### Analysis

We have performed linear regression of hours per week vs. each variable separately, as well as linear regression using all these variables together. 

This was done using the lm function of the purr package. For example: lm(hours_per_week~education,data) 

```{r, readRDS,include=FALSE}
age <- readRDS("../data/hours_age.rds")
relationship <- readRDS("../data/hours_relationship.rds")
education <- readRDS("../data/hours_education.rds")
sex <- readRDS("../data/hours_sex.rds")
all <-readRDS("../data/hours_all.rds")
```


Effect of age on hours per week:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
tidy(age)
```


Effect of relationship on hours per week:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
tidy(relationship)
```

Effect of education on hours per week:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
tidy(education)
```


Effect of sex on hours per week:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
tidy(sex)
```


Looking at the effect of all these variables on hours per week:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
head(tidy(all))
```

We seek to determine the difference in socioeconomic factors such as age, education, sex, and marital status between individuals earning less than and those earning more than $50,000 a year. 

To address this, we will answer the following research questions:

1. Is earing more than 50K correlated with the education level, marital status, and hours worked per week? 

```{r}

```

2. Is hours worked per week correlated with age, relationship, education level, or sex?

```{r}

```
